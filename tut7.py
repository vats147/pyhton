# This is single line comment

"""
    This
    is
    multiline
    comment

"""

# This is print statement
print("hello")
print("world")
"""
if we run both print statement we give output as in newline like 
output: hello
        world
        
but what if we need to need output on same line 
so here's are the solution

"""
#end say that print is not eneded yet so world is appended to hello with white space
print("hello",end=" ")
print("world")
